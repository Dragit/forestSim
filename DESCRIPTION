Description: 
    Provides tools for simulating and evaluating the performance of random forest models 
    as trees are added. Includes functions to track accuracy or mean squared error (MSE) 
    over time, run multiple simulations in parallel using `furrr`, and visualize growth 
    curves with `ggplot2`. Designed for benchmarking, educational use, and model stability analysis.
