Description: 
    Provides tools for simulating and evaluating the performance of random forest 
    models predicting values of categorial and continual parameters. As trees 
    are added. Includes a function that tracks accuracy (1 - OOB-Error) or mean 
    squared error (MSE) over time, run multiple simulations in parallel using 
    `furrr`, and visualize randomforest growth curves with `ggplot2`.  
    Make use of custom test sets, to improve feedback even further. Designed for 
    benchmarking, educational use, and model stability analysis.
